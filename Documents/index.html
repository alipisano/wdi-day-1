  <h1>Things I learned from Day 1 Reading</h1>
  <ul> 
  <li> What the W3C is and what it does. It sounds bananas and I spent a great deal of time reading the membership list. I'd like to be a part of any organization that includes both Netflix and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne. #diversity. </li>
  <li> HTML has roots, at least in name, in old school editing. </li>   
  <li> A basic understanding of what the DOM is, although I'm still not sure I totally get it. </li>
  </ul>
